		<!-- Intro -->
		<div>
			<p>"Rocky Raccoon" is a Beatles song composed by Paul McCartney, credited to Lennon-McCartney,
				and released on the 1968 album The Beatles or "<a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_(%C3%A1lbum)">White Album</a>". It is a parody of <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> 
				and <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash">Johnny Cash</a> ballads as well as "Back in the USSR", which parodies <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys">Beach Boys</a> songs.

		<!-- Origins of Creation -->
		<h3>Origins of Creation</h3>

		<p>Although the Beatles went to a transcendental meditation in Rishikesh, we see that, in musical terms, the record
			was little inspired by Indian musicality. This American western blues-style song was composed by Paul, who was
			inspired while playing with Lennon and <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan">Donovan</a> in India, with the help of George Harrison for the lyrics.</p>

		<p>The original name of the song's character was "Rocky Sassoon," but Paul changed it to "Raccoon" because he
			thought it "sounds more like a cowboy name." It tells the story of cowboy Rocky Raccoon (Rocky Raccoon).</p>

		<p>The lyrics parody the "tales" sung by Dylan and Cash. In this case, it's about a place on the dark mine hill in
			Dakota, where a young boy named Rocky Raccoon lived. Then one day his wife Nancy ran off with another guy named
			Daniel, but Rocky went to town for revenge and proposed a duel to "Dan", this one being faster, and hitting
			Rocky. The doctor finds him badly injured but he replies that "it's just a scratch and everything will get
			better." The lyrics also make a mention of the Bible distributed by Gideon's International ("Gideon's Bible"),
			saying that it helps in Rocky's recovery.</p>
